**DCE** has two different versions:

- **Graphical User Interface** (**GUI**) - it's the preferred version for newcomers as it is easy to use.
  You can get it by [downloading](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/releases/latest) the `DiscordChatExporter.*.zip` file.
- **Command-line Interface** (**CLI**) - offers greater flexibility and more features for advanced users, such as export scheduling, ID lists, and more specific date ranges.
  You can get it by [downloading](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/releases/latest) the `DiscordChatExporter.Cli.*.zip` file.

There are dedicated guides for each version:

- [Using the GUI](Using-the-GUI.md)
- [Using the CLI](Using-the-CLI.md)

## File formats

### HTML
