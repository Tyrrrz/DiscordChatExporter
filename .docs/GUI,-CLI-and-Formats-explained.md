# GUI or CLI?
![](https://i.imgur.com/j9OTxRB.png)
**DCE** has two different versions: 
* **Graphical User Interface** (**GUI**) - it's the preferred version for newcomers as it is easy to use.  
You can get it by [downloading](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/releases/latest) the `DiscordChatExporter.zip` file.    
* **Command Line Interface** (**CLI**) - offers greater flexibility and more features for advanced users, such as export scheduling, ID lists, and more specific date ranges.  
You can get it by [downloading](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/releases/latest) the `DiscordChatExporter.CLI.zip` file.

If you're not comfortable with **Windows'** Command Line (cmd), please choose the GUI.  
[**macOS**](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/blob/master/.docs/macOS-usage-instructions.md), [**Linux**](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/blob/master/.docs/Linux-usage-instructions.md) and [**Docker**](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/blob/master/.docs/Linux-usage-instructions.md) users can only use the CLI version.  

**(Skip to [Using the CLI](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/blob/master/.docs/GUI%2C-CLI-and-Formats-explained.md#using-the-cli) or [File Formats](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/blob/master/.docs/GUI%2C-CLI-and-Formats-explained.md#file-formats))**

### Guide
**1.** After extracting the `.zip`, open `DiscordChatExporter.exe`

**2.** Please refer to the on-screen instructions to get your token, then paste your token in the upper text box and hit ENTER or click the arrow (â†’).   
**NEVER SHARE YOUR TOKEN**. A token gives <u>full access</u> to an account, treat it like a password.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/SuLQ5tZ.png" height="400"/>

**3.** DCE will display your Direct Messages and a sidebar with your server list. Select the channel you would like to export, then click the ![](https://i.imgur.com/dnTOlDa.png) button to continue.  
> ðŸ’¡ Tip: You can export multiple channels at once by holding `CTRL` or `SHIFT` while selecting.  
> You can also double-click a channel to export it without clicking the ![](https://i.imgur.com/dnTOlDa.png) button.


<img src="https://i.imgur.com/JHMFRh2.png" height="400"/>

**4.** In this screen you can customize the following:
* **Export format** - HTML (Dark), HTML (Light), TXT, CSV and JSON

Click the menu button (â˜°) to see more options:

* **Date range (after/before)** (Optional) - If set, only messages sent in the provided date range will be exported. Only one value (either after or before) is required if you want to use this option.
  > Please note that the time defaults to **12:00 AM** (midnight/00:00). This means that if you choose to export between Sep 17th and Sep 18th, messages from Sep 18th won't be exported.
* **Filter** (Optional) - Special notation for filtering the messages that get included in the export. See [Message filters](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/blob/master/.docs/Message-filters.md) for more info.
* **Messages per partition** (Optional) - Split output into partitions, each limited to this number of messages (e.g. 100) or file size (e.g. 10mb). For example, a channel with 36 messages set to be partitioned every 10 messages will output 4 files.
* **Download assets** (Optional) - If this option is set, the export will include additional files such as user avatars, attached files, images, etc.  
Only files that are referenced by the export are downloaded, which means that, for example, user avatars will not be downloaded when using the plain text (TXT) export format.  
A folder containing the assets will be created along with the exported chat. They must be kept together.

**5.** Click `EXPORT` to export.

With this command you can export Server Channels and Direct Messages.

### Basic usage
You can quickly export with DCE's default settings by using just `-t token` and `-c channelid`.
```powershell
dotnet DiscordChatExporter.Cli.dll export -t "mfa.Ifrn" -c 53555
```

### Changing the format
You can change the export format to `HtmlDark`, `HtmlLight`, `PlainText` `Json` or `Csv` with `-f format`. The default format is `HtmlDark`.
```powershell
dotnet DiscordChatExporter.Cli.dll export -t "mfa.Ifrn" -c 53555 -f Json
```

### Changing the output filename
You can change the filename by using `-o name.ext`. e.g. for the `HTML` format:
```powershell
dotnet DiscordChatExporter.Cli.dll export -t "mfa.Ifrn" -c 53555 -o myserver.html
```

### Changing the output directory
You can change the export directory by using `-o` and providing a path that ends with a slash or does not have a file extension.
If any of the folders in the path have a space in its name, escape them with quotes (").
```powershell
dotnet DiscordChatExporter.Cli.dll export -t "mfa.Ifrn" -c 53555 -o "C:\Discord Exports"
```

### Changing the filename and output directory
You can change both the filename and export directory by using `-o directory\name.ext`.
Note that the filename must have an extension, otherwise it will be considered a directory name.
If any of the folders in the path have a space in its name, escape them with quotes (").
```powershell
dotnet DiscordChatExporter.Cli.dll export -t "mfa.Ifrn" -c 53555 -o "C:\Discord Exports\myserver.html"
```

### Generating the filename and output directory dynamically
You can use template tokens to generate the output file path based on the guild and channel metadata.

```powershell
dotnet DiscordChatExporter.Cli.dll export -t "mfa.Ifrn" -c 53555 -o "C:\Discord Exports\%G\%T\%C.html"
```

Assuming you are exporting a channel named `"my-channel"` in the `"Text channels"` category from a server called `"My server"`, you will get the following output file path: `C:\Discord Exports\My server\Text channels\my-channel.html`

Here is the full list of supported template tokens:

- `%g` - guild ID
- `%G` - guild name
- `%t` - category ID
- `%T` - category name
- `%c` - channel ID
- `%C` - channel name
- `%p` - channel position
- `%P` - category position
- `%a` - the "after" date
- `%b` - the "before" date
- `%%` - escapes `%`

### Partitioning
You can use partitioning to split files after a given number of messages or file size.  
For example, a channel with 36 messages set to be partitioned every 10 messages will output 4 files.
```powershell
dotnet DiscordChatExporter.Cli.dll export -t "mfa.Ifrn" -c 53555 -p 10
```

A 45mb channel set to be partitioned every 20mb will output 3 files.

```powershell
dotnet DiscordChatExporter.Cli.dll export -t "mfa.Ifrn" -c 53555 -p 20mb
```

### Downloading assets
If this option is set, the export will include additional files such as user avatars, attached files, images, etc.  
Only files that are referenced by the export are downloaded, which means that, for example, user avatars will not be downloaded when using the plain text (TXT) export format.  
A folder containing the assets will be created along with the exported chat. They must be kept together.

```powershell
dotnet DiscordChatExporter.Cli.dll export -t "mfa.Ifrn" -c 53555 --media
```

### Reuse assets
Previously downloaded assets can be reused to skip redundant downloads as long as the chat is always exported to the same folder. Using this option can speed up future exports. This option requires the `--media` option.

```powershell
dotnet DiscordChatExporter.Cli.dll export -t "mfa.Ifrn" -c 53555 --media --reuse-media
```


### Date formats
This setting changes how dates are formatted in the exported files.
* The default one is `17-Sep-19 11:34 PM` - `dd-MMM-yy hh:mm tt`
* To change it to `09-17-19 11:34 PM` use `MM-dd-yy hh:mm tt`
* To change it to `17/09/2019 23:34` use `dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm`
* To change it to `2019-09-17 23:34:05.6534` use `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.ffff`
* To change it to UTC `2019-09-18 04:34:05Z` use `u`
* To display the time zone, add `K`. E.g. to change it to `17-Sep-19 11:34 PM (UTC-05:00)` use `dd-MMM-yy hh:mm tt (UTCK)`
* To change it to Unix time `1568694845` use `unix`
* To change it to Unix time in milliseconds `1568694845653` use `unixms`

More info about .NET date formats [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/custom-date-and-time-format-strings).

```powershell
dotnet DiscordChatExporter.Cli.dll export -t "mfa.Ifrn" -c 53555 --dateformat "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm"
```

> Special thanks to [@andrewkolos](https://github.com/andrewkolos) for adding the Unix options

### Date ranges
**Messages sent before a date**  
Use `--before` to export messages sent before the provided date. E.g. messages sent before September 18th, 2019:
```powershell
dotnet DiscordChatExporter.Cli.dll export -t "mfa.Ifrn" -c 53555 --before 2019-09-18
```
**Messages sent after a date**  
Use `--after` to export messages sent after the provided date. E.g. messages sent after September 17th, 2019 11:34 PM:
```powershell
dotnet DiscordChatExporter.Cli.dll export -t "mfa.Ifrn" -c 53555 --after "2019-09-17 23:34"
```
**Messages sent in a date range**  
Use `--before` and `--after` to export messages sent during the provided date range. E.g. messages sent between September 17th, 2019 11:34 PM and September 18th:
```powershell
dotnet DiscordChatExporter.Cli.dll export -t "mfa.Ifrn" -c 53555 --after "2019-09-17 23:34" --before "2019-09-18" 
```

You can try different formats like `17-SEP-2019 11:34 PM` or even refine your ranges down to milliseconds `17-SEP-2019 23:45:30.6170`!  
Don't forget to quote (") the date if it has spaces!  
More info about .NET date formats [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/custom-date-and-time-format-strings).

# File formats

## HTML

![](https://i.imgur.com/S7lBTkV.png)
The HTML format replicates Discord's interface, making it the most user-friendly option.  
It's the best format for attachment preview and sharing.  
You can open `.html` files with a web browser, such as Google Chrome.  
> Please note that if a picture is deleted, or if a user changes its avatar, the respective images will no longer be displayed.  
Export using the "Download referenced assets" (`--media`) option to avoid this.

## Plain Text

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/PbUyRXD.png" height="400"/>

The Plain Text format is the best option for archiving due to its small size.  
You can open `.txt` files with a text editor, such as Notepad.

## JSON

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/FAeSA4O.png" height="400"/>

The JSON format contains more technical information and is easily parsable.  
You can open `.json` files with a text editor, such as Notepad.

## CSV

The CSV format allows for easy parsing of the chat log. Depending on your needs, the JSON format might be better.  
You can open `.csv` files with a text editor, such as Notepad, or a spreadsheet app, like Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets.
