# DiscordChatExporter

DiscordChatExporter can be used to export message history from a [Discord](https://discordapp.com) channel to a file. It works for both direct message chats and guild chats, supports markdown, message grouping, and attachments. The tool also lets you select from/to dates to limit the exported messages. There are options to configure the output, such as date format, color theme, message grouping limit, etc.
