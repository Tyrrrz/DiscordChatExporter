The information presented on this page is valid for **all** platforms.

## GUI or CLI?

**DCE** has two different versions:

- **Graphical User Interface** (**GUI**) - it's the preferred version for newcomers as it is easy to use.
  You can get it by [downloading](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/releases/latest) the `DiscordChatExporter.zip` file.
- **Command-line Interface** (**CLI**) - offers greater flexibility and more features for advanced users, such as export scheduling, ID lists, and more specific date ranges.
  You can get it by [downloading](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/releases/latest) the `DiscordChatExporter.CLI.zip` file.

If you're not comfortable with **Windows'** Command-line (cmd), please choose the GUI.
[**macOS**](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/blob/master/.docs/MacOS.md), [**Linux**](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/blob/master/.docs/Linux.md) and [**Docker**](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/blob/master/.docs/Docker.md) users can only use the CLI version.

There are dedicated guides for each version:

- [Using the GUI](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/blob/master/.docs/Using-the-GUI.md)
- [Using the CLI](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/blob/master/.docs/Using-the-CLI.md)

## File formats

### HTML

The HTML format replicates Discord's interface, making it the most user-friendly option.
It's the best format for attachment preview and sharing.
You can open `.html` files with a web browser, such as Google Chrome.

> **Warning**:
> If a picture is deleted, or if a user changes its avatar, the respective images will no longer be displayed.
> Export using the "Download referenced assets" (`--media`) option to avoid this.

### Plain Text

The Plain Text format is the best option for archiving due to its small size.
You can open `.txt` files with a text editor, such as Notepad.

### JSON
